# Movies-Recommendation-System
This repository contains a Python-based solution for analyzing movie rating data and performing several tasks to understand user preferences and movie suggestions.

## Tasks Overview
The project focuses on the following tasks:

1. **Top-5 Genres Based on Average Movie Rating**: Identify the top 5 genres with the highest average movie ratings.
2. **Movie Recommendation for a New User**: Suggest five movies to a new user and explain the rationale behind the suggestions.
3. **New User Creation and Rating Addition**: Create a new user by incrementing the maximum `UserID` and adding their ratings for specific movies.
4. **Stochastic Gradient Descent for Movie Recommendation**: Use SGD to predict ratings for movies and recommend five movies to the new user.
5. **TF-IDF Vectorizer for Movie Plot Similarity**: Use TF-IDF vectorization to find two movies with similar plots to "Judge Dredd" and evaluate the results.
